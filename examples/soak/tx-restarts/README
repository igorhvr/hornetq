****************************************************
* Soak Test For TX survival over restarts
****************************************************

Run The Test
==============

To run the test simply use ./build.sh

It's important that you always clean the data directory before starting the test, as it will validate for sequences generated.

The test will start and stop a server multiple times.


Run the server remotely
=======================

You can start the server directly if you want, you can just start the server as:

./run.sh PATH_TO_HORNETQ/examples/soak/tx-restarts/server0


Then you can run the test as:

./build.sh runRemote


And you can now kill and restart the server manually as many times as you want.
