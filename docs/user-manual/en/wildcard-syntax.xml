    <title>Understanding the HornetQ Wildcard Syntax</title>
    <para>HornetQ uses a specific syntax for representing wildcards in security settings,
        address settings and when creating consumers.</para>
    <para>The syntax is similar to that used by <ulink url="http://www.amqp.org">AMQP</ulink>.</para>
    <para>A HornetQ wildcard expression contains words delimited by the character '<literal
            >.</literal>' (full stop).</para>
    <para>The special characters '<literal>#</literal>' and '<literal>*</literal>' also have special
        meaning and can take the place of a word.</para>
    <para>The character '<literal>#</literal>' means 'match any sequence of zero or more
        words'.</para>
    <para>The character '<literal>*</literal>' means 'match a single word'.</para>
    <para>So the wildcard 'news.europe.#' would match 'news.europe', 'news.europe.sport',
        'news.europe.politics', and 'news.europe.politics.regional' but would not match 'news.usa',
        'news.usa.sport' nor 'entertainment'.</para>
    <para>The wildcard 'news.*' would match 'news.europe', but not 'news.europe.sport'.</para>
    <para>The wildcard 'news.*.sport' would match 'news.europe.sport' and also 'news.usa.sport', but
        not 'news.europe.politics'.</para>
