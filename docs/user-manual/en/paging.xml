    <title>Paging</title>
    <para>HornetQ transparently supports huge queues containing millions of messages while the
        server is running with limited memory.</para>
    <para>In such a situation it's not possible to store all of the queues in memory at any one
        time, so HornetQ transparently <emphasis>pages</emphasis> messages into and out of memory as
        they are needed, thus allowing massive queues with a low memory footprint.</para>
    <para>HornetQ will start paging messages to disk, when the size of all messages in memory for an
        address exceeds a configured maximum size.</para>
    <para>By default, HornetQ does not page messages - this must be explicitly configured to
        activate it.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Page Files</title>
        <para>Messages are stored per address on the file system. Each address has an individual
            folder where messages are stored in multiple files (page files). Each file will contain
            messages up to a max configured size (<literal>page-size-bytes</literal>). When reading
            page-files all messages on the page-file are read, routed and the file is deleted as
            soon as the messages are recovered.</para>

        <title>Dropping messages</title>
        <para>Instead of paging messages when the max size is reached, an address can also be
            configured to just drop messages when the address is full.</para>
        <para>To do this just set the <literal>address-full-policy</literal> to <literal
                >DROP</literal> in the address settings</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Blocking producers</title>
        <para>Instead of paging messages when the max size is reached, an address can also be
            configured to block producers from sending further messages when the address is full,
            thus preventing the memory being exhausted on the server.</para>
        <para>When memory is freed up on the server, producers will automatically unblock and be
            able to continue sending.</para>
        <para>To do this just set the <literal>address-full-policy</literal> to <literal
                >BLOCK</literal> in the address settings</para>
        <para>In the default configuration, all addresses are configured to block producers after 10 MiB of data are in the address.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Caution with Addresses with Multiple Queues</title>
        <para>When a message is routed to an address that has multiple queues bound to it, e.g. a
            JMS subscription, there is only 1 copy of the message in memory. Each queue only deals
            with a reference to this. Because of this the memory is only freed up once all queues
            referencing the message have delivered it. This means that if not all queues deliver the
            message we can end up in a state where messages are not delivered. </para>
        <para>For example:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>An address has 10 queues </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>One of the queues does not deliver its messages (maybe because of a slow
                    consumer).</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Messages continually arrive at the address and paging is started.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The other 9 queues are empty even though messages have been sent.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>In this example we have to wait until the last queue has delivered some of its
            messages before we depage and the other queues finally receive some more
            messages.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Paging and message selectors</title>
        <note>
            <para>Please note that message selectors will only operate on messages in memory. If you
                have a large amount of messages paged to disk and a selector that only matches some
                of the paged messages, then those messages won't be consumed until the messages in
                memory have been consumed. HornetQ does not scan through page files on disk to
                locate matching messages. To do this efficiently would mean implementing and
                managing indexes amongst other things. Effectively we would be writing a relational
                database! This is not the primary role of a messaging system. If you find yourself
                using selectors which only select small subsets of messages in very large queues
                which are too large to fit in memory at any one time, then you probably want a
                relational database not a messaging system - you're effectively executing queries
                over tables.</para>
        </note>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Paging and browsers</title>
        <note>
            <para>Please note that message browsers only operate over messages in memory. They do
                not operate over messages paged to disk. Messages are paged to disk
                    <emphasis>before</emphasis> they are routed to any queues, so when they are
                paged, they are not in any queues, so will not appear when browsing any queues.
            </para>
        </note>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Paging and unacknowledged messages</title>
        <note>
            <para> Please note that until messages are acknowledged they are still in memory on the
                server, so they contribute to the size of messages on a particular address. If
                messages are paged to disk for an address, and are being consumed, they will be
                depaged from disk when enough memory has been freed up in that address after
                messages have been consumed and acknowledged. However if messages are not
                acknowledged then more messages will not be depaged since there is no free space in
                memory. In this case message consumption can appear to hang. If not acknowledging
                explictly messages are acknowledged according to the <literal
                    >ack-batch-size</literal> setting. Be careful not to set your paging max size to
                a figure lower than ack-batch-size or your system may appear to hang! </para>
