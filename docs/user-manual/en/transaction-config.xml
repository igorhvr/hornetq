<chapter id="transaction-config">
    <title>Resource Manager Configuration</title>
    <para>HornetQ has its own Resource Manager for handling the lifespan of JTA transactions. When a
        transaction is started the resource manager is notified and keeps a record of the
        transaction and its current state. It is possible in some cases for a transaction to be
        started but then forgotten about. Maybe the client died and never came back. If this happens
        then the transaction will just sit there indefinitely.</para>
    <para>To cope with this HornetQ can, if configured, scan for old transactions and rollback any
        it finds. The default for this is 3000000 milliseconds (5 minutes), i.e. any transactions older
        than 5 minutes are removed. This timeout can be changed by editing the <literal
            >transaction-timeout</literal> property in <literal>hornetq-configuration.xml</literal> (value must be in milliseconds).
        The property <literal>transaction-timeout-scan-period</literal> configures how often, in
        milliseconds, to scan for old transactions.</para>
    <para>Please note that HornetQ will not unilaterally rollback any XA transactions in a prepared state - this must be heuristically rolled
    back via the management API if you are sure they will never be resolved by the transaction manager.</para>
